      <description>I am from Port Isabel, Texas, a small town on the southern Gulf Coast, where I graduated as valedictorian of Port Isabel High School. There, I founded the school’s first pre-medical organization, Future Health Careers Club, and was the president of the Student Body, National Honor Society, and Rotary Interact Club. I earned All-State Academic Elite Football Team Highest Honors and two State Championships in UIL Spelling and Vocabulary.</description>

      <description>This blog post will will demonstrate some examples of code used in Python. Python is software that is easy to learn and is very popular at the moment. It can be used to create graphs, charts, tables, and create significant research findings! Let’s take a look of some simple examples.
Python Demonstration:
Making a Dataset
dataset1=[10,20,30,40,50] dataset2=[60,70,80,90,100] dataset1 ## [10, 20, 30, 40, 50] dataset2 ## [60, 70, 80, 90, 100] Combining Sets</description>

      <description> Python and R are similar yet different programming techniques. The coding and software used can create incredible and fun data! To combine and work with both, we will use reticulate packages. Check out this example!
In R
library(reticulate) help_me&amp;lt;-&amp;quot;Learn How&amp;quot; In Python
help_me=&amp;quot;To Code&amp;quot; print(r.help_me,help_me) ## Learn How To Code In R
cat(c(help_me,py$help_me)) ## Learn How To Code </description>
